The corrected code ensures that `my-custom-class` is defined in your Tailwind configuration (usually `tailwind.config.js`) or that the class name is correctly spelled.

```html
<div class="bg-red-500 my-custom-class"></div>
```

**tailwind.config.js (Example):**

```javascript
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      textColor: {
        'my-custom-class': '#f00',
      }
    }
  }
}
```

In this solution, we directly use the class `my-custom-class` (assuming it is defined correctly in your Tailwind config), removing the `@apply` directive which was causing issues due to the misspelling or absence of the class definition. Using `@apply` is still possible if `my-custom-class` is correctly defined in the config file.

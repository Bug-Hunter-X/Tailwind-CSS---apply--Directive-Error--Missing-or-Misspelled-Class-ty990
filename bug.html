This error occurs when using Tailwind's `@apply` directive with a class that doesn't exist or is misspelled.  For example:

```html
<div class="bg-red-500 @apply my-custom-class"></div>
```

If `my-custom-class` is not defined in your Tailwind configuration or is misspelled, Tailwind will not apply any styles, and you might not get an explicit error message, leading to unexpected visual results.
